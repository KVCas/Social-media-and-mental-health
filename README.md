# Social Media and Mental Health in Canada: 
## Analyzing data on social media and its impact on the mental health of Canadian teenagers

### Introduction
In light of the increased use of social media, mental health professionals and the public have paid more attention to the relationship between social media and mental well-being. As social media platforms become more embedded in daily life, it's important to understand their impact on mental health. This project aims to explore the effects of social media usage on the mental well-being of adolescents in Canada. By web-scraping information from articles published in _Statistics Canada_ and _Government of Canada_, I will present survey findings to gain a better understanding of the correlation and the effects on the adolescent population.

This project will focus on the following questions:

  - Has the increase in online presence and consumption directly impacted the adolescent population, and what are those effects? And those effects, do they directly affect the mental well-being of adolescents, and to what capacity?
